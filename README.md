* The Genetic Algorithm codes are available in the GA class. <br />
     **     The chromosome class is used in the GA class to define chromosomes.
    
 <br />
 
* The Scenario class contains simulation codes that simulates an R&M plan produced by GA. Simphony.Net is used to create this class. <br />
     **     The Technician class is utilized to model personnel resources. <br />
     **     The RepairTasks class is used to define R&M tasks as simulation entities. <br />
     **     The Cost class is used to calculate cost functions.
