# Simulation-based-Optimization
These codes are provided as parts of an optimization module in a project concerning scheduling repair and maintenance work-orders in hospitals.
<br />
<br />
<br />

* The Genetic Algorithm codes are available in the GA class. <br />
     **     The chromosome class is where the chromosomes used in the GA class are defined.
    
 <br />
 
* The Scenario class contains simulation codes that serve as the fitness function for evaluating the GA chromosome. Simphony.Net is used to create this class. <br />
     **     To define the only resource used in simulation, the Technecian class is provided. <br />
     **     The Simulation entities are defined in the RepairTasks class. <br />
     **     The Cost class is used to make simulation calculations easier.
