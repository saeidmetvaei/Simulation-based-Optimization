# Simulation-based-Optimization
These codes are provided as parts of an optimization module in a project concerning scheduling repair and maintenance work-orders in hospitals.


* The Genetic Algorithm codes are available in the GA class.
    # The chromosome class is where the chromosomes used in the GA class are defined.
    
 
* The Scenario class contains simulation codes that serve as the fitness function for evaluating the GA chromosome. Simphony.Net is used to create this class.
    # To define the only resource used in simulation, the Technecian class is provided.
    # The Simulation entities are defined in the RepairTasks class.
    # The Cost class is used to make simulation calculations easier.
