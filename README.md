# Simulation-based-Optimization
These codes are provided as parts of an optimization module in a project concerning scheduling repair and maintenance work-orders in hospitals.



* The Genetic Algorithm codes are available in the GA class.
     The chromosome class is where the chromosomes used in the GA class are defined.
    
 
* The Scenario class contains simulation codes that serve as the fitness function for evaluating the GA chromosome. Simphony.Net is used to create this class.
     To define the only resource used in simulation, the Technecian class is provided.
     The Simulation entities are defined in the RepairTasks class.
     The Cost class is used to make simulation calculations easier.
